- Enter your private key and bet amount and click "Set" button. Your private key is **securely** stored on your local machine.

- Choose PancakeSwap or CandleGenie at the bottom of the bot

- Click "Start The Bot" and just wait. Bot will do everything automatically. He will even collect the awards himself.

### If you want to run CLI instead of extension

1. Copy **.env.example** to **.env** `cp .env.example .env`
2. Provide your private key to **.env** PRIVATE_KEY field
3. Install dependencies `npm i` or `yarn`
4. Start THIS BEAST `npm run start` or `yarn start`

- For CandleGenie `npm run cg` or `yarn cg`
- For Experimental Strategy add `--exp` flag

By default the CLU version will run cg btc. You can choose which to bet on:

- BTC: `npm run cg` and `npm run cg-btc`
- BNB: `npm run cg-bnb`
- ETH: `npm run cg-eth`
